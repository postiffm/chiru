Output from Bible Edit to do Build new Chiru App to eliminate /v markers

Noticed that references to Mark were not working.  
Example:  Title of Mathew 10 has references to Mar 3:13-19

Changed /toc3 from MRK to MAR, from JHN to JOH, from ACT to TIR

Matthew 10 title for Mark example
Acts 9:16 Title for TIR
Matthew 14:22 for JOH
